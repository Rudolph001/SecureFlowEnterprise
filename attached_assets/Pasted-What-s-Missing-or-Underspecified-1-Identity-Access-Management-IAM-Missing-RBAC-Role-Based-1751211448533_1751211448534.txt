What's Missing or Underspecified
🔐 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
Missing:

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

SSO (SAML/OAuth2 for enterprise login)

Admin vs. user privilege separation

Why it matters: Essential for compliance, enterprise control, and audit integrity.

🌩️ 2. Cloud-Native Deployment Infrastructure
Missing:

Kubernetes or Docker orchestration

CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)

Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

Why it matters: Without this, you can't reliably deploy, scale, or secure the platform across cloud environments.

📤 3. Inline Email Enforcement (Mail Flow Control)
Missing:

Actual email intervention mechanisms (e.g., blocking/quarantining an outbound/inbound message before it’s delivered)

Integration with Exchange Transport Rules / Gmail Routing Policies

Why it matters: Tessian doesn’t just observe — it acts inline. You're missing the part that actually alters email delivery.

🛠️ 4. Add-In Configuration Controls
Missing:

Silent vs. active warning mode toggles (per user, per policy)

Centralized add-in configuration and telemetry

Why it matters: Enterprise add-ins must be configurable at scale — not just installable.

🧪 5. Automated Testing, Model Validation, and Retraining Pipelines
Missing:

Unit/integration testing for ML models

Model drift detection and auto-retraining pipeline (possibly with MLflow or Kubeflow)

Why it matters: Keeping models fresh and production-safe requires lifecycle management.

📊 6. Threat Intelligence & Enrichment
Missing:

Integration with threat intel feeds (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, etc.)

Entity enrichment (IP reputation, domain age, etc.)

Why it matters: ML models alone won’t catch everything. Context from the outside world helps.

🧠 7. Dynamic Learning & Feedback Loops
Missing:

User “Report phishing” feedback buttons

Feedback ingestion pipelines to improve model accuracy

Why it matters: Active learning from users helps reduce false positives and negatives over time.

📦 8. Multi-Tenant Support (If SaaS Platform)
Missing:

Tenant isolation in data, policy, users, analytics

Why it matters: If you intend to scale commercially, SaaS-style multi-tenant architecture is key.

📈 9. Usage Analytics, Telemetry, and Licensing
Missing:

Admin usage metrics (e.g., blocked emails over time, most risky users)

Licensing model & feature flag system

Why it matters: Helpful for sales, product development, and internal reporting.

🧰 10. Disaster Recovery & High Availability
Missing:

Backup & restore plan

Load balancing and failover

Why it matters: This is critical for enterprise environments that require 99.99% uptime.
