# Identity Integration Checklist

## Enterprise Identity Provider Options

### Option 1: SAML SSO Integration ⭐ RECOMMENDED for 10,000+ users
- [ ] **Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)**
  - [ ] Configure SAML 2.0 endpoints
  - [ ] Set up attribute mapping (email, firstName, lastName, department)
  - [ ] Test with pilot group (100-500 users)
  - [ ] Configure group-based role assignment
  
- [ ] **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**
  - [ ] Set up Enterprise Application
  - [ ] Configure SAML assertions
  - [ ] Map Azure AD groups to SecureFlow roles
  - [ ] Enable conditional access policies
  
- [ ] **Okta Enterprise**
  - [ ] Create SAML application in Okta
  - [ ] Configure attribute statements
  - [ ] Set up group-based provisioning
  - [ ] Test single sign-on flow

### Option 2: SCIM Provisioning (Automated User Management)
- [ ] **User Lifecycle Management**
  - [ ] Automatic user creation on first login
  - [ ] Role assignment based on AD groups
  - [ ] Automatic deprovisioning when user leaves
  - [ ] Regular sync of user attributes
  
- [ ] **SCIM 2.0 Implementation**
  - [ ] Set up SCIM endpoint in SecureFlow
  - [ ] Configure identity provider SCIM connector
  - [ ] Map user attributes (department, manager, location)
  - [ ] Test bulk user operations

### Option 3: API-Based Integration
- [ ] **Custom Integration**
  - [ ] Develop REST API for user management
  - [ ] Implement JWT token validation
  - [ ] Create user sync service
  - [ ] Build role assignment automation

## Technical Requirements Checklist

### Infrastructure
- [ ] **Database Scaling**
  - [ ] Plan for 10,000+ user records
  - [ ] Implement database indexing strategy
  - [ ] Set up read replicas for performance
  - [ ] Configure connection pooling
  
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**
  - [ ] Implement Redis for session management
  - [ ] Cache user roles and permissions
  - [ ] Set up distributed caching for multi-region
  
- [ ] **Load Balancing**
  - [ ] Configure application load balancers
  - [ ] Set up health checks
  - [ ] Plan for auto-scaling groups

### Security
- [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - [ ] Integrate with existing MFA solution
  - [ ] Support for TOTP, SMS, hardware tokens
  - [ ] MFA bypass for service accounts
  
- [ ] **Certificate Management**
  - [ ] Obtain SSL certificates for SAML endpoints
  - [ ] Set up certificate rotation process
  - [ ] Configure certificate validation

## Integration Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot Testing (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Test with 10 IT administrators
- [ ] Verify SAML authentication flow
- [ ] Test role assignment and permissions
- [ ] Validate user provisioning/deprovisioning

### Phase 2: Department Rollout (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Roll out to IT Security team (50-100 users)
- [ ] Test under moderate load
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics

### Phase 3: Full Deployment (Week 5-8)
- [ ] Gradual rollout by department
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Support user training and adoption
- [ ] Fine-tune based on usage patterns

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Governance
- [ ] Document data retention policies
- [ ] Implement audit logging for user actions
- [ ] Set up compliance reporting
- [ ] Configure data backup and recovery

### Privacy Protection
- [ ] Minimize data collection to essential fields
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Set up user consent management
- [ ] Configure right to be forgotten procedures

## Cost Estimation
